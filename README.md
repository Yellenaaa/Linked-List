# Linked-List

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple linked list in C. It includes basic operations such as adding nodes at the beginning, inserting nodes at a specific position, deleting nodes, and printing the linked list. 

## Features
- Create a new node
- Add nodes at the beginning
- Insert nodes at a specific position
- Delete nodes from the list
- Print the entire list
- Traversal of the list

## Data Structure Overview
A **linked list** is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains two parts:
1. **Data**: The actual data stored in the node.
2. **Next**: A pointer that points to the next node in the list (or NULL if itâ€™s the last node).

The linked list allows for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions/deletions at arbitrary positions.
